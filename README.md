    Assignment 3 - Pizza Bandit Signup and Ordering

    You've followed along with me all semester so far with the Pizza Bandit program.  This assignment sees us completing that assignment for the ReactJS-only portion of the course.  You'll accomplish and complete the following:
        Create a basic ReactJS app
        Create a form that allows a user to sign up with an account
            email and password
            save this information to Firebase
        Create a form that allows a user to order a pizza
            user must be signed in
            use location services to get lat/lon
            use a web service to get ZIP code from lat lon
            select from three pizzas - cheese, pepperoni, and supreme
        Order sourcing and order saving
            Using ZIP code find nearby Pizza places - we'll use a real web service here
        Confirmation and delivery screen
            finalize delivery street address
            show delivery street address on mapbox
            You'll save the order to Firebase
            You'll confirm the order via an email

    This is a significant undertaking and the remainder of our class time between then and now will focus on these requirements.

    The first eight chapters of the Thomas book are instructive in getting this completed.
